Boot and shutdown your FreeNAS from your Mac

I have written a small utility to control your FreeNAS from Mac OSX. It's written in Java and there is still room for improvements. The software is free for any use and you can find the code on Github
https://github.com/m1markus/NasControl
There you find also all the info on how to install and configure the software. If you are not a developer or just don't want to build from source yourself, you can grab the install DMG file from here
https://github.com/m1markus/NasControl/releases/tag/v0.6.0-rc1
Give it a try and write me what you think of it.
